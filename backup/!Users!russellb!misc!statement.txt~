My story is one of tenacity.  I have endured stretches of homelessness, days without nourishment, and the burden of absolute personal responsibility without guidance.  The hopelessness of poverty was my birthright; fortitude and unrelenting optimism were my weapons to fight it.  Where life has shown me obstacles, I have only improved.
