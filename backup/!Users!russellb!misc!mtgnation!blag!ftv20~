I've been working to build a UW Legacy Miracles deck lately, and I recently reached a milestone of sorts.  All I needed was Planeswalkers and Land.  That sounded nice, worded like that.  The truth is, I needed 2 Jace, the Mind Sculptors, 2 Tundras, a Volcanic Island, 9 Fetchlands, and a Karakas.  Yikes.

Then I heard the news.  Jace in From the Vault 20?!  And a Venser for my sideboard, too!  I was sold.  I gathered the necessary information.  My local card shop, the Armored Gopher, was indeed selling (10) FTV20 sets.  They were selling first-come, first-serve, and they recommended camping.  Count me in.

On the night before FTV20's release, I showed up at the Gopher about 20 minutes before close.  Two other guys were there at close, for a total of three.  By midnight, there were 5 of us.  And lucky for the rest of those guys, I came prepared.  I brought extra lawn chairs, sufficient blankets for a padded play area/ bed, a pauper cube, and some constructed decks.
