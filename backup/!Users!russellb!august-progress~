PacletDeploymentsData 1.0
 - Finished Jenkins plugin for displaying deployment information.
 - Debugged, fixed a null value bug, moved to our git server.
 - Created jenkins job for building the plugin.
 - Installed plugin on re-monitor.

PacletDeploymentsData 1.1
 - Researched using Jenkins api for exposing deployment information.
 - Wrote up information collected on api process
 - Created dedicated page for deployment information on each Paclet
 - Exposed my plugin data to the remote api

 - Plugin Interop with Mathematica [PacletDeploymentsData.m]
  -- Wrote mathematica script for polling PacletDeploymentsData api and generating table.
  -- functions for grabbing data as formatted table or as a list.

RE-Monitor (Jenkins) design update
 - update appearance for more of an internal Wolfram feel
  -- Replaced 'Jenkins' header with 'Wolfram RE'
  -- Updated color scheme to match Wolfram
  -- Replaced Jenkins asset with Wolfram Spikey

RE-Monitor paclet 'templates'
 - looked into a plugin for this purpose (not good)
 - messed with scriptler and hudson docs
 - decided there were basically three decent options:
  (1) make Paclet its own class (extends Job) and instantiate Paclet jobs from that
  (2) write our own plugin for templating jobs
  (3) keep system we have while managing 'factory' tasks with scriptler Groovy scripts

 - it turns out (2) was unnecessary, as Bobby Hogard found a Jenkins inheritance-plugin that fits the bill.

Paclet Management with Scriptler
 - wrote some simple sample groovy scripts for reference

Job versioning in RE-Monitor
 - investigated SCM wrapper classes in jenkins
 - wrote script for creating a clone of a job with a different SCM branch
 - looked for best solution for pushing new branch upstream

Mathematica Tutorial
 - started Mathematica 100 tutorial, but abandoned for M221 upon recommendation

Inheritance-Plugin
 - tutorial
 - investigated backing up build history for jobs
 - wrote script to help with moving Paclet builds to new plugin
